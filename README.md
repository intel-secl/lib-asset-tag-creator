## Key features
- Provides interface to create Asset Tag Certificates

## System Requirements
- RHEL 7.5/7.6
- Epel 7 Repo
- Proxy settings if applicable

## Software requirements
- git
- maven (v3.3.1)
- ant (v1.9.10 or more)

# Step By Step Build Instructions
## Install required shell commands
Please make sure that you have the right `http proxy` settings if you are behind a proxy

$ ant
```

# Links
 - Use [Automated Build Steps](https://01.org/intel-secl/documentation/build-installation-scripts) to build all repositories in one go, this will also provide provision to install prerequisites and would handle order and version of dependent repositories.

***Note:** Automated script would install a specific version of the build tools, which might be different than the one you are currently using*
